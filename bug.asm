mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10.  If ecx is very large, or if ebx is not properly aligned, this can lead to a segmentation fault or other memory access violations.  The issue is exacerbated if ecx is not properly validated before this instruction.  The lack of bounds checking for ecx is a common source of this type of error.
